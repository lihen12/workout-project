# Design Plan for Redesigned Site

The purpose of the redesign is to make a website that allows the user to log their workout regiment. 

We will slowly add HTML as we progress with the site. All changes are tentative and not indicative of the final design. 

A primary focus is making sure that the backend services work well with the front end UI and functionality.  

We will experiment with spacing and different module layouts. However, the primary goal is to create a functional website first before the aesthetics.


## Design Plan for Site's Colors

Main background color will be a light color, whether it is white. This will cover the nav bar and footer as well. 

For solid background colors of content, we want different hues of soft, light colors. 


## Design Plan for Site's Typography

Body and heading typography will be of Fira Sans. A bit of a professional style, but still visually pleasing and casual. 


## Design Plan for Site's Layout

Site layout will be more simple than old without omitting important educational content. 

*   We want to maintain the integrity of the logo without changes. Having it at the top across all sites. 
*   The Nav will be right under the logo along with the search bar. 
*   There will not be multiple pages. Just simply the logger for users to interact with. 
*   Multiple pages will be added in the future. 
*   The footer is at the bottom. This will contain social media, share buttons, secondary nav (?)

# Design-Components


## Design-Components: 

### Logo

Create a logo and have it at top of every page, consistently, so the nav bar remains in once place.

Do not repeat the logo on the home page as with the existing site.


## Design-Components: Navigation

We want to use a fixed nav at the top of our page under the logo. Should be responsive for both web and mobile. Mobile friendly comes first. 

We wil have a burger nav to sort by workout to track history. Followed by a secondary nav. 

Categories:

* Today
* History
* Graph (?)


### Main Page - Today

This will be the page that allows users to track their workout for the day they are working out. 

* Have multiple blank spaces for users to scroll down and pick, search, or type a workout they are going to do. 

** This is followed by weight, reps as a sub child. 

** Each set has it's own row under the workout user picks. 


### Track

This will be a clean and simple design that tracks the weight, reps, dates of workouts. 

* Add weight

* Add reps

* Add date

* Under user-input, will display what user input over time. 

### History 

This will be more date specific. Will show what workouts you did for what date.

* Date

** Workout

*** Each set of the workout with weight and reps

### Graph

This will display a graph of your weight progress over time of the average of your reps.

* 1 month

* 3 months

* 6 months

* 1 year

Each point will tell you of the respective week, month depending on which filter you choose.
